[Virtual Machine](VM.md) | [Using Computing Environments]() 

Computing Environment Workshop
----------------------------------

The goal of this workshop is to demonstrate the value of automatically creating computing environments. At the end of this workshop, you should be able to understand how to configure and automatically create a virtual machine for programming tasks.

When developers think about virtual machines, a common idea that comes to mind is a dedicated heavy-weight virtualized system with a full graphics Desktop. Alternatively, you may think of dual-booted systems. While these types of systems can be useful, this is not what 

We define a *computing environment* as 

Headless environments.
